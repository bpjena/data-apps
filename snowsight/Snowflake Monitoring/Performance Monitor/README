Please note that the Short and Long Queries Development Guide is only necessary if you need to create short and long queries dashboard. 
For other dashboards that are focused on performance, you do not need to refer to the Short and Long Queries Development Guide.

Therefore, if you are not creating a dashboard that is specifically focused on short and long queries, you do not need to go through this guide.
